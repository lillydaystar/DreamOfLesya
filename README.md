# Lesya's Dream

Lesya's Dream is a 2D game developed in Java, inspired by the classic game "Mario Bros." The project was created by Liliia Parashchak and Kyrylo Pervushyn as part of our course at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.

## Game Description

Lesya's Dream is a platformer game set in a magical world filled with creatures from Ukrainian mythology. The main character, a Cossack named Marian, embarks on a journey through this enchanting realm, aiming to find a way back to his real life. The game features challenging levels and introduces new elements and mechanics as the player progresses.

The concept of the game is similar to the iconic "Mario Bros." game developed by Nintendo in 1983. It is a two-dimensional platformer where all the action takes place on a single screen. The goal is to eliminate the enemies.

## Project Goals

The following goals were set for the development of Lesya's Dream:

* Implement player movement (left and right), jumping, and attacking.
* Create multiple levels and maps for the player to explore.
* Design unique antagonists that will attack the main character.
* Incorporate collectible coins for the player to gather.
* Include a bestiary with descriptions of all creatures encountered.
* Implement power-ups and bonuses to enhance the player's abilities.
* Design a final boss battle.

Each antagonist in the game represents a distinct mythical creature with its own abilities and skills. Lesya's Dream comprises four levels set in different locations, each with its own set of creatures that become increasingly challenging as the player progresses.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the main Java file to launch the game.
4. Use the arrow keys to control Marian's movement, the spacebar to jump, and a specific key for attacking.
5. Explore the levels, defeat enemies, collect coins, and reach the final boss to complete Lesya's Dream.
